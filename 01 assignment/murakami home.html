Haruki Murakami (January 12, 1949) is a contemporary Japanese writer. His books and stories have been best-sellers in Japan as well as internationally, with his work being translated into 50 languages and selling millions of copies outside his native country.
<br><br><br>
Murakami's fiction, still criticized by Japan's literary establishment as un-Japanese, was influenced by Western writers from Chandler to Vonnegut by way of Brautigan. It is frequently surrealistic and melancholic or fatalistic, marked by a Kafkaesque rendition of the "recurrent themes of alienation and loneliness" he weaves into his narratives. He is also considered an important figure in postmodern literature. Steven Poole of The Guardian praised Murakami as "among the world's greatest living novelists" for his works and achievements.
